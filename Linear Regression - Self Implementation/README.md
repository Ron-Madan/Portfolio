This program utilizes Binary Search in hopes of indentifying the best slope and y-intercept for a linear set of data.

Here is a sample piece of data:

points = [[11, 75.3], [25, 100], [47, 97.4], [73, 136.1], [110,140], [159, 145], [233, 159.8], [258, 178.1]]

Here is the 'Line of Best Fit' discovered by the program:

Moreover, when comparing this model with the Calculus-defined formula, the results are incredibly similar:

--> Binary Search: y = 0.3125x + 93.75 (PURPLE)

--> Calculus-Defined: y = 0.3464x + 89.3011 (DASHED RED)
