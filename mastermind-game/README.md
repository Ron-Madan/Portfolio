The Mastermind game is a puzzle where you must figure out the correct sequence of 5 colours! Play it [here](https://mastermind-game-7s5g2p9u0-raunak-madans-projects.vercel.app)!

In this game, you make guesses and the feedback on the right side informs you of the correctness of your guess. Concretely,

If you get stuck, you can ask the AI to come up with an intelligent guess for you! The AI tries to optimize the guess made by minimizing the remaining solution space. Notably, if you continuously ask the AI for help, you can usually beat the game within 5 tries!
