# 8-Puzzle Solver using A* Search Algorithm

This project implements a solution for the classic 8-puzzle problem using the A* (A-star) search algorithm with Manhattan Distance heuristic. Feel free to check it out, [HERE](https://8-puzzle-xi.vercel.app/)!

## About the 8-Puzzle

The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3Ã—3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles from a given starting configuration to reach a specific goal configuration by sliding tiles into the empty space. If you're feeling ambitious, you can also try the 15-puzzle on a 4x4 grid!

## How to Play?

You can click on any tile adjacent to the blank square to move that tile into the blank space. If you get stuck, hit "Solve" and watch the AI work its magic!

## Implementation Details

### A* Search Algorithm

The solver uses the A* search algorithm, which is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start state to a goal state. A* uses both:

- **g(n)**: The cost to reach the current node from the start state
- **h(n)**: A heuristic estimate of the cost from the current node to the goal
- **f(n)**: The total estimated cost, where f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

### Manhattan Distance Heuristic

The implementation uses Manhattan Distance with linear conflict detection:

1. **Basic Manhattan Distance**:
   - Calculate horizontal and vertical distance between current and goal positions for each tile
   - Sum these distances for all tiles (excluding the empty space)

2. **Linear Conflict Enhancement**:
   - Adds penalties when two tiles are in their goal row/column but in reverse order
   - Each linear conflict adds 2 moves to the heuristic estimate
   - Example: If tiles 1 and 2 are in their goal row but 2 appears before 1, this requires at least 2 additional moves to resolve

### Solver Optimizations

#### State Representation
- **String-based State Tracking**: States are converted to strings for efficient hash table lookups in the visited set
- **Immutable State Handling**: Each new state is created using array spreading to prevent unintended state mutations

#### Search Optimizations
- **Priority Queue Implementation**: Custom MinHeap implementation for efficient O(log n) insertion and removal of states
- **Early Goal Detection**: Checks for goal state immediately after generating each new state
- **Move Generation**:
  - Pre-calculated move directions (up, down, left, right)
  - Efficient boundary checking for valid moves

#### Memory Management
- **Visited State Tracking**: Uses a Set data structure for O(1) lookup of previously seen states
- **Path Reconstruction**: Maintains path history to reconstruct solution
- **Memory-Efficient Node Structure**: Only stores essential information in each node:
  - Current state
  - Path history
  - g-score (path cost)
  - h-score (heuristic value)

## Usage
```
import { aStar } from './Solver.js';
const startState = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 6, 7, 5, 8];
const goalState = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0];
const solution = aStar(startState, goalState);
```

## Time Complexity

- **Worst Case**: O(b^d), where b is the branching factor (maximum 4 in 8-puzzle) and d is the solution depth
- **Space Complexity**: O(b^d) to store the nodes in the open list

## Limitations

- Not guaranteed to find a solution for unsolvable puzzle configurations
- Memory usage can be significant for complex puzzles due to storing visited states
