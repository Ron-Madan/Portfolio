This program is a Visual Word Search Solver. It takes in a list of lists, where each list contains the text contained in a given row of the Word
Search. The program will start crossing out all of the words - if they appear in the text - and display the appropriate markings on the screen.

The program utilizes a form of Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and combines the strategy that a human would take in finding a given word. I.e. Find the first
letter, set a direction to follow, keep moving along the specified direction, and finally, check if the next appropriate letter keeps appearing until the
last letter has been reached.

Here is a demo of the program in action:
