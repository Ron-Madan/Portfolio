/* Final Project: StreetFighter
 * Raunak Madan
 * Program Description:
 * This program creates the game StreetFighter within Java. In the main menu, use the 
 * "HISTORY" button to view the history of all games previously played. The text area 
 * displays the most recent game at the top. Also, you are able to enter in a user's name
 * in a text-field and view how many wins they have. In the main menu, you can also click 
 * on the "START" button to move to the character selection menu. Essentially, you and your 
 * friend can choose who wants to play as Ken and who wants to play as Ryu. From there, you
 * can click on "GO" to move on to the wild card portion of the game. Here, by clicking on a 
 * card, a random effect is added to the game. For instance, you could get 'Half Damage', 
 * 'Double Damage', 'Double Speed', or no effect. After receiving your wild card effect, 
 * you will be informed of the controls for the game. Not to mention, the controls are spaced
 * out in a way such that your hands do not collide with your friend's, which allows for a smooth
 * game play experience. In particular, player 1, AKA Ken, uses the W/A/D keys to move and C/V/B for 
 * special abilities such as shooting a fireball, blocking, and kicking. Player 2, AKA Ryu, 
 * uses the arrow keys to move and I/O/P for special abilities. Keep in mind that you can 
 * also specify a jump direction by pressing either the left key (or A) or the right key 
 * (or D) with the up key (or W). The goal of the game is to KO (or Knock-Out) the other 
 * player by reducing their health. Depending on your wild card's effect, you will do 15 
 * (times the damage factor) damage to the other player when you kick or throw a fireball. 
 * If the other player blocks, in the CORRECT DIRECTION, then they will take 1/3 of the 
 * usual damage. Note that if your fireball and your friend's fireball collide, they will 
 * destroy each other. In like manner, if you and friend are kicking each other, no one 
 * will take damage and you will both be set back. Moreover, if you are losing, don't worry! 
 * When you get to critical health, AKA health less than or equal to 30, a power up will 
 * appear above your location. By colliding with it, you are granted a one-time UNBLOCKABLE 
 * attack (kick or fireball) that does 40 damage to the other player. To clarify, it doesn't 
 * matter if you miss the kick or fireball, on your next successful attack, you WILL do 40 
 * damage to the other player. However, this power is only granted for 1 successful attack. 
 * Finally, when a player gets to 0 health, the game will end. At this point, you can select 
 * the option to return to the main menu and start once more, or exit the game if you've had 
 * your full share of enjoyment. Lastly, if you do decide to go back to the main menu and 
 * click on history, you'll notice that the game you just played is at the top of the text area. 
 * Have fun!
 * 
 * Program Details:
 * Main Class:
 * The Main class is as essential part of the game. It connects the various classes
 * together and allows the game to function. To begin, there are several booleans that are
 * used to check for the players' movement. There are also numerous Timelines created to 
 * essentially allow the game to function. For instance, there are Timelines that creates
 * fireballs after a certain amount of time- in order for the player gifs to complete their cycle.
 * Not to mention, there are Timelines used to cause delay between fireball creation so that the 
 * players do not spam that ability. Likewise, to allow the player to kick only when they have
 * released the key and pressed again, there are booleans such as player1KickAllowed that help
 * to accomplish that feature. The animation AnimationTimer is significant because it calls the
 * various methods that allow for movement, such as the moveHor method in the Player class. That
 * AnimationTimer also checks whether the player is in the air and whether they are kicking or 
 * blocking, and restricts movement accordingly. The Main class also allows for jumping to occur because an 
 * array of quadratic y-values - which are scaled for the height of the screen by multiplying them
 * by the height/18 - allow the user to somewhat experience a jump. This is accomplished through 
 * jump index integer values for each player, which slowly increment in a KeyFrame and adjust the 
 * position accordingly. Moreover, to easily create and remove Fireball objects for each player,
 * an ArrayList of type Fireball is utilized. The Main class also has various methods that are constantly 
 * called from a KeyFrame that check various collisions in the game. For example, to check for collision between 
 * fireballs, the collisionTimer's associated KeyFrame calls upon the checkFireballCollision() method. 
 * That method uses the .getBoundsInParent() method to check for intersection between the fireballs using the
 * .intersect method. The Main class also takes care of health bars and adjusts their width when the player takes 
 * damage. This is accomplished through the Rectangle object's setWidth method. The kick KeyFrames also check 
 * whether both players are kicking at the same time - by referencing their in-built isKicking booleans - and uses 
 * the setBack() method in the Player class to push them both back Finally, the various Methods in main also 
 * check for the players' health and create a power up sprite depending on whether one was previously created 
 * - using the powerUpCreated boolean. Lastly, the restart() method in Main takes care of restarting the 
 * game as the players are re-initialized, the powerUpCreated boolean (along with other booleans) are 
 * set back to their original state and the text area is refreshed (or called upon again using a method in 
 * Menu) - in order to display the most recent game played. That also includes setting the speed and damage 
 * factor variables back to 1 so that the wild card's effect has ended.
 * 
 * Menu Class:
 * The Menu class utilizes JavaFX layouts in order to create the various scenes of the game. In particular,
 * GridPanes are used to add elements such as TextFields, Labels, Buttons and TextAreas to the correct location. This
 * specific example was incorporated into the creation of the 'History' page. On another note, the Menu class
 * is responsible for sorting the names of the winners using the Selection Sort algorithm, searching for a user-
 * entered name using Binary Search, and displaying the number of wins that a certain user has. The Menu class
 * also uses a 2D array to store the location of the Wild card pixel values, along with the effect that each
 * wild card has - which is obtained by getting a random integer from the Random class. The Menu class is also
 * important because it manages the transitions between the various scenes of the game. A variable - scroller - 
 * is updated whenever the user moves to a different portion of the game. The reason being, all buttons are set
 * to call the navigation() method when they are called - and that method updates the scroller value depending
 * on which button submit the action. This is incorporated into a timer in Main, which constantly checks the Menu
 * class' scroller value. Finally, the Menu class has a reset() method that sets the scroller value back to its
 * original state (AKA 0), clears the various TextFields and re-initializes the ArrayLists so that the TextArea has
 * the most recent information if the user decides to see the updated history.
 * 
 * Player Class:
 * The Player class is what allows the Ryu and Ken classes to function. The Player class is the main structure
 * of both the Ryu and Ken classes - as they use inheritance to extend upon the Player class. Specifically, the Player
 * class has several booleans, which constantly update Main about several aspects of each player - such as whether
 * the player is kicking, blocking, shooting a projectile, has a power up, and more. It also has a method to adjust the
 * player's health when they take damage, and it updates the isDead boolean if the health property falls below 1. Moreover,
 * to make the players move, the setX/Y methods are used to set the location of the ImageView. In particular, the moveHor
 * method takes in an amount, checks the direction and space on the screen, and calls the setX method. Furthermore, the setBack
 * method is used to push the player back by a distance of 30 - depending on which direction they are facing. This is very
 * similar to how the moveHor method works - with the exception that you move 30 in the opposite direction. This method is
 * called in situations where the player gets kicked or hit by a fireball. It is also used when both players kick each other at
 * the same time- giving the impression that both players were jolted back by the force. Lastly, there are methods like setXYZ
 * which set booleans' values and set the player's direction. The getXYZ methods return values like the x-Position and y-Position.
 * 
 * Ryu / Ken Class:
 * These classes extend upon the Player class. In their constructors, they set the appropriate direction and have
 * their own setImage() methods, which reference the appropriate images that those players need (i.e. Ken or Ryu images).
 * Based on a variety of situations that the player can be in, the setImage() method checks the state of various booleans
 * and sets the object's image to correspond to that environment.
 * 
 * Fireball Class:
 * The Fireball class is used to create fireballs for both player 1 and 2. It uses the setPosition method to set itself to
 * the appropriate direction and location depending on where the user is - by getting the user's location and direction as 
 * inputs. The isOffScreen() method checks if the fireball has left the screen, which informs the fireball animation 
 * KeyFrame to remove that specific fireball from the Pane. This check is accomplished by using the x-Position, the 
 * fireball's width, and the width of the room. Finally, the move() method adjusts the x-Position of the fireball by 10
 * depending on the direction of the fireball. In like manner with the Player class, the Fireball class also has the setX
 * method, which updates the ImageView's location - which is called from the move() method.
